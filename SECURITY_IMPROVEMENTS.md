# Security Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified and the improvements implemented to enhance the security posture of the Aayra Smart Study application.

## Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded API Keys and Secrets
**Issue**: Supabase API keys were hardcoded in the source code, exposing them in version control.

**Fix**: 
- Moved API keys to environment variables using `import.meta.env`
- Created `.env.example` file for documentation
- Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
- Added validation to ensure required environment variables are present

**Files Modified**:
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- `.env.example` (created)
- `.env` (created)
- `.gitignore`

### 2. Information Disclosure via Console Logs
**Issue**: Sensitive information including user IDs and storage operations were being logged to console.

**Fix**:
- Removed console.log statements that exposed user IDs
- Removed debug logging for storage operations
- Kept only essential error logging for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useReviewOperations.ts`
- `src/hooks/useSessionData.ts`

### 3. Insufficient File Upload Validation
**Issue**: File uploads lacked proper size and type validation, potentially allowing malicious files.

**Fix**:
- Added file size validation (10MB limit)
- Implemented strict file type checking using MIME types
- Added user feedback for validation failures
- Clear file input on validation errors

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/UploadPage.tsx`

### 4. URL Validation Vulnerabilities
**Issue**: URL inputs were not validated, potentially allowing malicious URLs or XSS attacks.

**Fix**:
- Added URL format validation
- Restricted to HTTP/HTTPS protocols only
- Added user feedback for invalid URLs

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/UploadPage.tsx`

### 5. Insecure Content Moderation
**Issue**: Content moderation used hardcoded offensive word lists that could be a security risk.

**Fix**:
- Replaced explicit word lists with pattern-based detection
- Implemented regex patterns for more secure filtering
- Removed offensive content from source code
- Added severity levels for different content types

**Files Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useContentModeration.ts`

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Environment Variable Management
- All sensitive configuration moved to environment variables
- Clear documentation of required variables
- Validation of required environment variables at startup

### Input Validation
- File upload restrictions (size, type)
- URL format validation
- Content filtering and moderation

### Information Security
- Removed sensitive data from logs
- Pattern-based content filtering instead of explicit lists
- Proper error handling without information disclosure

### Version Control Security
- Added `.env` to `.gitignore`
- Created `.env.example` for documentation
- Removed hardcoded secrets from source code

## Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Security Recommendations for Production

1. **API Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
2. **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers to prevent XSS
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure all communications use HTTPS
5. **Security Headers**: Implement security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
6. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security assessments
7. **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
8. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without information disclosure

## Testing Security Improvements

1. **Environment Variables**: Verify application fails gracefully when required env vars are missing
2. **File Upload**: Test file size limits and type restrictions
3. **URL Validation**: Test with various URL formats including malicious ones
4. **Content Moderation**: Test with various content types to ensure proper filtering

## Monitoring and Alerting

Consider implementing:
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring
- Unusual file upload pattern detection
- Content moderation alert system
- Environment variable validation alerts

**Note**: This security implementation provides a solid foundation, but security is an ongoing process. Regular reviews and updates are essential to maintain a secure application.
